# Jenkins Tutorial

Jenkins (the Jenkins Project) is an open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project. It is supported by a large and growing community of developers, testers, designers, and other people interested in continuous integration, continuous delivery, and modern software delivery practices.

Jenkins is built on top of Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Therefore, Java Development kit needs to be installed for Jenkins to work.
