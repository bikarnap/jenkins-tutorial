# Jenkins Pipeline
The Jenkins Pipeline comprises a suite of plugins designed to enable the creation and integration of continuous delivery pipelines within the Jenkins environment. It offers a versatile range of tools for representing delivery pipelines, from straightforward to intricate, using a code-based approach through the Pipeline DSL.

"Pipeline DSL" refers to the domain-specific language used to define and configure continuous delivery pipelines within Jenkins. This DSL provides a set of commands and syntax that are specifically designed for describing the steps and stages of a software delivery process, making it easier to create, manage, and automate these pipelines within Jenkins.

A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated representation of the steps involved in taking software from its initial version in source control all the way to its final release for users and customers. Each software change, as it's committed to source control, undergoes a structured journey towards its release. This journey includes the consistent and dependable creation of the software (known as a "build") and its progression through various stages of testing and deployment.

A Jenkins Pipeline's definition is written in a text file known as a "Jenkinsfile." This Jenkinsfile can then be added to the project's source control repository. This approach forms the basis of "Pipeline-as-code," where the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is considered an integral component of the application, subject to versioning and review, similar to other code elements.

## Why Pipeline?
At its core, Jenkins serves as an automation engine that accommodates various automation patterns. The Pipeline plugin enhances Jenkins by offering a robust suite of automation capabilities, catering to a wide range of use cases, from straightforward continuous integration to comprehensive continuous delivery pipelines. By structuring a sequence of interconnected tasks, users can harness the numerous advantages of the Pipeline:

1. Code-Centric: Pipelines are expressed through code and are typically stored in source control, empowering teams to modify, review, and refine their delivery pipelines.

2. Resilient: Pipelines exhibit resilience by persisting through both planned and unexpected restarts of the Jenkins controller.

3. Pause and Resume: Pipelines can be configured to pause and await human input or approval before resuming their execution.

4. Flexibility: Pipelines are adaptable to intricate real-world continuous delivery requirements, allowing for branching, merging, looping, and concurrent work.

5. Extensibility: The Pipeline plugin supports the incorporation of custom extensions to its domain-specific language (DSL) and provides multiple integration options with other plugins.

# Creating a Jenkins Pipeline
Before creating a Jenkins Pipeline, it is necessary to make sure that the "Pipeline" plugin is installed in Jenkins. In case it is not installed, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available," search for "Pipeline," and install it. Refer to this YouTube video for a walkthrough of installing Jenkins plugins.

The initial step for creating a Jenkins Piepline is similar to creating a Jenkins Freestyle project (job). Creating a Jenkins Piepline project thus involves the following steps:
1. In the Jenkins dashboard, click on the _+ New Item_ menu
2. Provide a name to the project and click on the _OK_ button
3. Configure the Pipeline: In the pipeline configuration, you have two options for defining your pipeline: "Pipeline script" and "Pipeline script from SCM."

  - For simple pipelines, you can use "Pipeline script." In the "Pipeline" section, select "Definition" as "Pipeline script" and enter your pipeline code in the text area.

  - For more complex pipelines or when you want to store your pipeline code in a version control system, choose "Pipeline script from SCM." This option allows you to fetch your pipeline code from a Git repository, for example.
4. Save and Run the Pipeline:
   After defining your pipeline, save the configuration. You can manually trigger the pipeline by clicking "Build Now."

5. View Pipeline Progress:
   You can view the progress of your pipeline on the project's dashboard. Jenkins will display the pipeline stages and their execution status.

## Example Pipeline
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Building the application"'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Running tests"'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Deploying the application"'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The stages and steps can be defined in the stages section according to your project's requirements.
