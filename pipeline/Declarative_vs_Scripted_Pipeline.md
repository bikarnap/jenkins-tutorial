# Declarative and Scripted Pipeline
Jenkins provides two main approaches for defining and configuring pipelines: Declarative and Scripted. In this tutorial, we'll explore the differences between Declarative and Scripted pipelines and help you choose the right one for your needs.

## Declarative Pipeline
A Declarative Pipeline is a high-level syntax for defining your pipeline in Jenkins. It is designed to be simpler and more human-readable, making it a great choice for straightforward build and deployment processes.

An example of Declarative Pipeline is as follows:
'''
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Building the application"'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Running tests"'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Deploying the application"'
            }
        }
    }
}
'''

### Key Features of Declarative Pipeline
- Simplicity: Declarative pipelines are concise and easy to read, making them suitable for straightforward CI/CD tasks.
- Limited Groovy Knowledge: You don't need an in-depth understanding of Groovy scripting to create Declarative pipelines.
- Structured Syntax: Pipelines are divided into stages and steps for a clear, organized flow.

## Scripted Pipeline
A Scripted Pipeline, on the other hand, provides more flexibility and power. It allows you to write Groovy code directly in your pipeline script, giving you full control over your build and deployment processes. Scripted pipelines are ideal for complex and customized scenarios.

An example of Scripted Pipeline is as follows:
'''
node {
    stage('Build') {
        sh 'echo "Building the application"'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        sh 'echo "Running tests"'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        sh 'echo "Deploying the application"'
    }
}
'''

### Key Features of Scripted Pipeline
- Flexibility: Scripted pipelines offer complete flexibility, allowing you to write Groovy code to customize your pipeline.
- Advanced Use Cases: They are suitable for complex build and deployment processes that require advanced logic and external integrations.
- Steep Learning Curve: Creating Scripted pipelines requires a good understanding of Groovy scripting, which can be challenging for beginners.

# Choosing Between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines
- Use Declarative Pipeline when:
  * Your build and deployment process is relatively simple.
  * You prefer a structured and human-readable syntax.
  * You want to keep your pipeline code minimal and maintainable.

- Use Scripted Pipeline when:
  * You have complex or highly customized CI/CD requirements.
  * You need full control over your pipeline logic.
  * You are comfortable with Groovy scripting and are willing to invest in more advanced pipeline development.

# Conclusion
Both Declarative and Scripted pipelines in Jenkins offer powerful ways to automate your CI/CD processes. Your choice between them should depend on the complexity of your project's requirements and your familiarity with Groovy scripting. By understanding the differences between these two pipeline types, you can select the one that best suits your needs and effectively manage your software delivery workflows.
